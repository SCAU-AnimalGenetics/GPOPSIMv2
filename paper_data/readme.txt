Dear readers

The dataset is used to validate new funtions of GPOPSIM. New function see the paper "The theory on and software simulating large-scale genomic data for genotype-by-environment interactions".
In the paper, in each scenarion , we use 20 random seeds to simulate 20 replicates. 
Due to too large files, we only upload one replicate for g by e and threshold trait,respectively. You can change random seed to simulate another replicates.

The fold " threshold trait" : data to validate the funtion of smulating threshold trait
          "single-2": one binary trait with an incidence of 0.3
          "single-3":three-category trait with an incidence of 0.3 for the first category and an incidence of 0.4 for the second category
          "two-2": binary- quantitative traits with an incidence of 0.3
